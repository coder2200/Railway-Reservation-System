  <li>Where piped water supply is possible, potable drinking water should be supplied on platform by provision of taps<br> at the rate of one tap for two coaches. On island platforms if the trains are expected to be received on both sides at<br> the same time, number of taps should be doubled.</li>
  
  <li>At small stations, as determined by the Commercial Department, where provision of piped water supply is technically<br> and economically not feasible, tube-wells with hand pumps should be provided. The size, numbers and locations of such<br> tube wells should be determined by the Engineering Department,- based on the quantum of passenger traffic at the station.</li>
  
  <li>In addition, potable drinking water should be supplied through mobile or stationary water containers. The number, size,<br> type and deployment of such mobile containers should be determined by the Commercial Department who shall also<br> procure & maintain them.</li></ul>

    Waiting rooms are available at major stations for use by genuine passengers. These can be used free of cost on production of journey tickets<br> for a few hours till the connecting train arrives. Till departure train comes.
 <u><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></u> 
 The Railways are mandated to provide for basic facilities like safe drinking water, clean toilets, proper lighting,<br> etc. at the stations as well as in the trains, besides maintaining an acceptable level of cleanliness. Further, the<br> general infrastructure of the stations like lifts, escalators, waiting rooms, etc. are some of the basic services<br> which constitute passengers amenities. The Standing Committee on Railways on Passenger Amenities and<br> Safety strongly recommended that the provision/maintenance/ augmentation of amenities should be undertaken<br> by the Railways on a uniform pattern and also that Railways re-visit their station-category-based passenger amenities<br> approach and implement a multi-pronged strategy by synergizing technology, user awareness, provision of mechanized equipment as well as penalty provisions<br><br>
